## General info
  An Exploratory Data Analysis Project done on the data on Stocks of 4 Tech companies .
  The aim of the project is to explore the data read from Yahoo to analyze the stock trends and predict the risk factor as well as future behavior of the stock.
  The analysis is sub-divided into following parts:
  1. What is the change in price of stock overtime?
  2. What was the daily return of stock on average?
  3. What was the moving average of the various stock?
  4. What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
  5. What was the correlation between different stocks' daily return?
  6. How much value do we put in risk by investing in a particular stock?
  7. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
